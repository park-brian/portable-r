This program helps package R code so it can be distributed to users who may not have R installed.

The installation script will: 

1. Download and extract the contents of the R 3.3.0 installer
2. Set the extracted instance of R to use a portable library path
3. Create a template for your portable application in the source directory

A sample application is included with this script that illustrates a possible use-case for this tool.

The source code for this installation script is available at:
