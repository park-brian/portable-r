This program helps package R code so it can be distributed to users who may not have R installed.

The installation script will: 

1. Download R 3.3.0
2. Extract R from the installer using innoextract
2. Configure R to use a portable library path
3. Create a portable application template in the source directory

A sample application is included with this script that illustrates a possible use-case for this tool.

The source code for this installation script is available at:
